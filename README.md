# Gene-Expression-Analysis
This repository contains R scripts for analyzing human gene expression data using RNA-Seq count data. The project focuses on differential gene expression analysis using the edgeR package.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
	â€¢	Dataset: Gene expression data from six human tissues and three donors.
	â€¢	Goal: Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across tissues.
	â€¢	Methods Used:
	â€¢	Data filtering & normalization (calcNormFactors)
	â€¢	Multidimensional scaling (MDS) for visualization
	â€¢	Differential expression analysis (exactTest)
	â€¢	Gene classification (Tissue-Specific, Elevated, Not-Elevated)
